<h2>Description</h2>
The project on Automotive Sales Analysis using Tableau and SQL involves leveraging data visualization and database querying techniques to gain insights into the sales performance of Automotive Sales.
In the project, SQL is employed to extract, clean, and transform relevant data from a database containing information about automotive sales. This data includes details such as sales figures, models, manufacturers, regions, and time periods.
Once the data is prepared, Tableau is utilized to create interactive and insightful visualizations. These visualizations include dashboards, charts, and graphs that showcase key metrics, trends, and patterns in automotive sales.

<h2>Problem Statement:</h2>
<b>The automotive industry faces a critical challenge in effectively analyzing and understanding sales performance due to the complex and voluminous nature of sales data. Existing systems often lack efficient tools for comprehensive data extraction, transformation, and visualization. This hinders the ability of stakeholders to make informed decisions, identify key trends, and optimize strategies for improving automotive sales. To address this issue, a project integrating Tableau and SQL is proposed, aiming to provide a streamlined and insightful analysis of automotive sales data. This solution aims to empower industry professionals with the tools needed to navigate and interpret large datasets, ultimately facilitating more informed decision-making and enhancing the overall performance of automotive sales.</b>
